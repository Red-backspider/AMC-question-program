# AMC question
Anne wrote down a pattern of numbers starting from zero by adding 20, subtracting 1, adding 19, subtracting 2, adding 18, subtracting 3, until she went back to zero. (You can see it is a pattern and what you add goes down and what you subtract goes up.) What was the largest number achieved in this pattern?
# My python solution
This overcomplicates it but this program can find the largest number in the pattern shown above but also gives you an infinite range of different problems that it can solve, not just the above example.
# How to run
Simply download [python]([url](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) and run this program via IDLE or the command prompt/terminal.
